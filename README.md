Zara Sales Exploratory Data Analysis

This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a Zara sales dataset to examine how pricing relates to sales performance across different product categories.

After cleaning and validating the dataset, statistical analysis and visualizations were applied to identify:

Sales volume distribution across categories

Revenue concentration patterns

The relationship between price and demand

Average sales behavior across price ranges

The analysis reveals consistent price sensitivity across categories, with sales volume generally decreasing as price increases. Jackets emerge as the primary driver of both revenue and units sold, indicating a strong concentration within the product portfolio.

The project aims to demonstrate practical data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and business-oriented insight generation using Python.
