This project conducts an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a Zara sales dataset to investigate how pricing and seasonal factors relate to sales performance. After cleaning and validating the data, statistical analysis and visualizations were used to identify distribution patterns, average sales behavior, and potential business insights for decision-making.
