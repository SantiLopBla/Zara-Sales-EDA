# Zara Sales Exploratory Data Analysis
## Overview
- This project presents a structured exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a Zara sales dataset to identify key business drivers, revenue concentration patterns, promotion impact, and price sensitivity across product categories.

- The goal is to extract actionable insights that could support portfolio, pricing, and promotional decisions.

## Key Findings
### Revenue & Sales Concentration

- Total Sales Volume: 22.2M units

- Total Revenue: $884.6M

- Jackets account for 55% of both total sales and total revenue

- Jackets generate 3.41× more revenue than the second-best category

- This indicates a strong dependence on a single product category.

### Promotion Strategy

- Jackets have the highest number of promotional items (4,697). However, promotion rates are similar across categories (≈40–43%). This suggests that jacket dominance is not solely driven by higher promotional intensity, but by stronger category demand and scale.

### Category Performance

- Sweaters and jackets perform slightly above the overall average in sales per item.

- Jeans, shoes, and t-shirts perform slightly below average.

- Since promotion exposure is consistent across categories, performance differences likely reflect intrinsic demand rather than promotional imbalance.

- Price Sensitivity

- Moderate negative correlation between price and sales volume (-0.34).

- Lower-priced items show higher average sales.

- Demand decreases gradually as prices increase, indicating moderate price sensitivity.

## Methodology

- Data cleaning and validation

- Sales and revenue concentration analysis

- Promotion rate analysis

- Correlation analysis

- Price binning and density visualization

- Comparative performance analysis

## Tools

- Python

- Pandas

- Matplotlib

- Seaborn

- Jupyter Notebook

## Strategic Insight

- The business shows a high concentration risk, with over half of total revenue depending on jackets. While this reflects strong demand and effective positioning, it also highlights potential vulnerability if performance in this category declines.

- Diversifying revenue drivers could improve long-term stability.
